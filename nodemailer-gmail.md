# Setup `nodemailer` for `Gmail`

Following steps should be taken to configure the gmail for server-side mail sending:

1. Make sure that `2-Step Verification` is turned `Off`
2. Login to the `google` account.
3. Go to `Settings > Manage yor google account > Less secured apps`
4. Turn it `On`
5. Go to [Google Display Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) and `enable` it.
6. In Sha Allah the rest is in the [nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/) and should be done in the backend!
